	\index{quantum!Significance in limits}

For a many particle system of weekly interacting particles, will quantum 
effects be more important for (a) high densities or low densities and (b) 
high temperatures or low temperatures for a system. Explain your answers in 
terms of the de Broglie wavelength $λ$ defined as $λ² ≡ h²⁄(3mk_BT)$ where 
$m$ is the mass of the particles and $k_b$ Boltzmann's constant.

\subsubsection{Answer}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\alph{enumi})}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
		High density — The de Broglie wavelength gives a ``size'' of the 
		particle, and in the high density limit, the wavefunctions overlap 
		significantly so quantum effects and interactions are critical to 
		the behavior of the system.
	\item
		Low temperature — Since $λ² \propto T^{-1}$, as $T → 0$, $λ$ increases
		so that again the wavefunctions overlap and quantum effects are
		significant.

The ground state energy of Helium is \SI{-79}{\eV}. What is its ionization
energy, which is the energy required to remove just one electron?

\subsubsection{Answer}
Using the Hydrogen solution with modifications for single-electron atoms of
higher $Z$, we know that the ground state energy of singly ionized Helium is
\begin{align*}
	E_{He}^{1} = 2² (\SI{-13.6}{\eV}) = \SI{-54.4}{\eV}
\end{align*}
Therefore, the difference between the singly-ionized and neutral ground state
energies gives the first ionization energy of the Helium atom.

	\index{dimensional analysis!Vacuum (Casimir) force}

It is known that the force per unit area ($F/A$) between two neutral 
conducting plates due to polarization fluctuations of the vacuum (namely, 
the Casimir force) is a function of $h$ (Planck's constant), $c$ (speed of 
light), and $z$ (distance between the plates) only. Using only dimensional 
analysis, obtain $F/A$ as a function of $h$, $c$, and $z$.

\subsubsection{Answer}
The units of $F/A$ are
\begin{align*}
	\frac{F}{A} &= \left[ \frac{\si{\kg}}{\si{\m\s\squared}} \right]
\end{align*}
The \si{\kg} suggests a factor proportional to $h$, making the equation
\begin{align*}
	\frac{F}{A} &\sim \left[ \frac{1}{\si{\m\cubed\s}} \right] h \\
\intertext{Accounting for the factor of seconds requires a $c$:}
	\frac{F}{A} &\sim \left[ \frac{1}{\si{\m\tothe{4}}} \right] hc \\
\intertext{Finally, account for all the factors of distance:}
	\frac{F}{A} &\sim \frac{hc}{z⁴} \\
\end{align*}
Therefore,

	\frac{F}{A} &\sim \frac{hc}{z⁴}

In the circuit diagram opposite, initially the two identical capacitors with 
capacitance $C$ are uncharged. The connections between the components are 
all made with short copper wires. The battery is an ideal EMF and supplies a 
voltage $V$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
		At first Switch A is closed and Switch B is kept open. What is the 
		final sotred energy on capacitor $C_a$?
	\item
		Switch A is opened and afterwards Switch B is closed. What is the 
		final energy stored in both capacitors?
	\item
		Provide a physical explanation for any difference between the 
		results of parts (a) and (b), if there is one.

		;
		% Go back and draw capacitor A
		\draw (between) to [capacitor=$C_a$] ++(0,-2);
	\end{circuitikz}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Answer}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
		Initially, the right side of the circuit with $C_b$ can be ignored, 
		so the total energy is simply the energy stored within $C_a$.
		\begin{empheq}[box=\fbox]{align}
			E &= \frac 12 CV²
		\end{empheq}
	\item
		The system is now effectively just the two capacitors on the right.
		Because the voltage difference is supported across both capacitors,
		the system can be modeled as an effective capacitor in parallel
		\begin{align*}
			C_{eff} &= 2C
		\end{align*}
		The total charge stored by the capacitors must remain the same when
		switching from Switch A being closed to Switch B. Initially,
		\begin{align*}
			Q &= CV_i
		\end{align*}
		and afterwards it is
		\begin{align*}
			Q &= C_{eff}V = 2CV_f
		\end{align*}
		so the final voltage across the capacitors is
		\begin{align*}
			V_f &= \frac 12 V_i
		\end{align*}
		This means the total energy is
		\begin{align*}
			E &= \frac 12 C_{eff} {V_f}²
		\end{align*}
		\begin{empheq}[box=\fbox]{align}
			E &= \frac 14 CV²
		\end{empheq}
	\item
		The energy is dissipated (heat, fields, etc).

	\index{mechanics!Angular momentum of a planet}

A planet of mass $m$ moves around the sun, mass $M$, in an elliptical orbit 
with minimum and maximum distances of $r₁$ and $r₂$, respectively. Find the 
angular momentum of the planet relative to the center of the sun in terms of 
these quantities and the gravitational constant $G$.

\subsubsection{Answer}
We solve the problem using conservation of energy since we know that stable
elliptical orbits have constant energy. The generic equation is
\begin{align*}
	E &= \frac{L²}{2I} - \frac{GMm}{r}
\end{align*}
where $L$ is the angular momentum and $I$ the moment of inertia. Substituting
for the values at both $r₁$ and $r₂$ and equating,
\begin{align*}
	\frac{L²}{2m{r₁}²} - \frac{GMm}{r₁} &= \frac{L²}{2m{r₂}²} - \frac{GMm}{r₂}\\
	\frac{L²}{2m}(\frac{1}{{r₁}²} - \frac{1}{{r₂}²}) &=
		GMm(\frac{1}{r₁} - \frac{1}{r₂})
\end{align*}
which leads to the solution
\begin{empheq}[box=\fbox]{align}
	L &= \sqrt{ \frac{2GMm² r₁ r₂}{r₁ + r₂} }

A particle moves in a circular orbit under the influence of a central force
that varies as the $n$-th power of the distance. Show that this motion is
unstable if $n < -3$. (Hint: Consider the centrifugal potential.)

See solution for Fall 2011 Part I, Problem 2 with the condition inverted so
that \emph{in}stability is $n < -3$ rather than stability requiring $n > -3$.

	\index{thermodynamics!Isentropic compression}
	
A classical, ideal, monatomic gas of $N$ particles is reversibly compressed 
\emph{isentropically}, i.e.~with the entropy kept constant, from an initial 
temperature $T₀$ and pressure $P$ to a pressure $2P$. Find (a) the work done 
on the system, and (b) the net change in entropy of the system and its 
surroundings.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
		An isentropic process is the same as an adiabatic process since no
		heat can be exchanged ($T\dd S = Q = 0$), so we begin with the relation
		that $PV^{γ}$ is a constant. Combining this with the ideal gas law, 
		we can determine that
		\begin{align*}
			P^{1-γ}T^{γ} = \mathrm{const}
		\end{align*}
		where $γ = C_p/C_v$ is the ratio of heat capacities with $C_p =
		\frac 52 Nk_B$ and $C_v = \frac 32 Nk_B$ for a monatomic ideal gas. 
		Using this, we solve for the final temperature of the system after 
		compressions as
		\begin{align*}
			T_f &= 2^{2/5} T₀ ≈ 1.32T₀
		\end{align*}
		Combining both of
		\begin{align*}
			ΔU &= C_v ΔT \\
			ΔU &= Q + W
		\end{align*}
		where $Q = 0$, we get that
		\begin{empheq}[box=\fbox]{align}
			W &= \frac 32 Nk_B T₀ (2^{2/5} - 1)
		\end{empheq}
	\item
		Because the compression is done reversibly, by definition, $ΔS = 0$.
