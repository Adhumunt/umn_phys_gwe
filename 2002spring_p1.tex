	\index{thermodynamics!Arbitrary engine efficiency}

An engine using \SI{1}{\mol} of an ideal diatomic gas performs the cycle $A
\rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow A$ as shown in the diagram below. $A
\rightarrow B$ is an adiabatic expansion, $B \rightarrow C$ occurs at
constant pressure, and $C \rightarrow A$ takes place at constant volume.
What is the efficiency of the cycle?

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
	>=stealth
    ]
    % Draw the axes
	\draw [->] (0,0) -- (0,3) node [anchor=south] { P [\si{atm}] };
	\draw [->] (0,0) -- (5,0) node [anchor=west] {V [\si{\L}]};

	% Then draw the engine cycle
	\draw [very thick,dashed,->] (1,1)    -- (1, 2.64)
	    node [anchor=south] {A};
	\draw [very thick,dashed,->] (1,2.64) parabola[bend at end] (4,1)
	    node [anchor=west] {B};
	\draw [very thick,dashed,->] (4,1)    -- (1,1)
	    node [anchor=north east] {C};
	;

	% Then draw in the labels that give the absolute numbers
	\draw [dashed] (1,2.64) -- (0,2.64) node [anchor=east] {2.64};
	\draw [dashed] (1,1) -- (0,1) node [anchor=east] {1.00};
	\draw [dashed] (1,1) -- (1,0) node [anchor=north] {10};
	\draw [dashed] (4,1) -- (4,0) node [anchor=north] {20};

\subsubsection{Answer}

Since we want to find the efficiency of the cycle, we only care about the
heat exchanged during each stage of the cycle. Because the path $A
\rightarrow B$ is adiabatic, we immediately know that $Q = 0$. Then
proceeding to look at the stage $C \rightarrow A$, we know that the work
done during this cycle is identically zero since there is no area under the
curve. That means we are left simply with the equation
\begin{align*}
    dU = dQ
\end{align*}
Because this is an ideal [diatomic] classical gas, we combine the equations
\begin{align*}
    U &= \frac 52 nRT
\intertext{and}
    PV &= nRT
\end{align*}
to get that the difference in energy across the path is
\begin{align*}
    Q_{CA} &= U = \frac 52 nR(T_A - T_C) \\
    {}&= \frac 52 V₁ (P₂ - P₁)
\end{align*}

For the remaining stage $B \rightarrow C$, we use the full thermodynamic
identity:
\begin{align*}
    dU &= dQ - P\,dV
\end{align*}
The pressure $P₁$ is constant, so both integration of $dU$ and $dV$ are simply
the differences in each quantity. Again substituting for the temperature in
$U$ with the ideal gas law,
\begin{align*}
    \frac 52 nR(T_C - T_B) &= Q_{BC} - P₁(V₁ - V₂) \\
    \frac 52 P₁(V₁ - 2V₁) &= Q_{BC} + P(V₁ - 2V₁) \\
    Q_{BC} &= -\frac 72 P₁V₁
\end{align*}

We've accounted for all the heat flow in the system. $Q_{BC}$ is negative, so
this is the heat flow out of the system, while $Q_{CA}$ is positive and is the
heat flow into the system. By definition then, the efficiency $η$ of the system
is
\begin{align*}
    η &= 1 - \frac{Q_{out}}{Q_{in}} \\
    {}&= 1 - \frac{\frac 72 P₁ V₁}{\frac 52 V₁ (P₂ - P₁)} \\
    {}&= 1 - \frac 57 \frac{P₁}{P₂ - P₁}
\end{align*}
Plugging in the given values, we find the efficency to be
\begin{empheq}[box=\fbox]{align}
    η &= 0.146 = \SI{14.6}{\percent}
\end{empheq}
