Assume you have three identical particles and three single particle states $|a\rangle$, $|b\rangle$, and $|c\rangle$ available for them. Count how many different three-particle states there can be if the particles are $(a)$ fermions, and $(b)$ bosons.

\subsubsection{Answer}
Fermionic statistics exclude two fermions living in the same energy state, thus there are $3!$ different particle states for fermions. Bosonic statistics allow an arbitrary number of bosons to live in the same energy, thus there are $3^3$ different particle states for bosons.

Show that a particle in a one-dimensional infinite square well initially in a
state $\psi (x,0)$ will always return to that state after a time $T = 4ma^2/{\pi}{\hbar}$
where $a$ is the width of the well.

\subsubsection{Answer}
Use the standard time independent Sch\"odinger equation
\begin{align*}
	\psi (x,t) &= \psi (x) e^{iEt/{\hbar}}
\end{align*}
with associated differential equation
\begin{align*}
	-\frac{{\hbar}^2}{2m} \frac{d^2\psi }{dx^2} + V(x)\psi  &= E\psi 
\end{align*}

For an infinite square well, the potential has the form
\begin{align*}
	V(x) &=
		\begin{cases}
			0	&	|x| < \frac{a}{2} \\
			\infty 	&	\text{otherwise}
		\end{cases}
\end{align*}
so that the only region to consider is $-\frac{a}{2} < x < \frac{a}{2}$. In this
region, the differential equation takes the form of a harmonic oscillator
\begin{align*}
	\frac{d^2\psi }{dx^2} &= -\frac{2mE}{{\hbar}^2}\psi 
\end{align*}
leading to solutions
\begin{align*}
	\psi (x) ={}& A\cos kx + B\sin kx \\
	{}& \text{where } k^2 = \frac{2mE}{{\hbar}^2}
\end{align*}

The boundary conditions $\psi (-\frac{a}{2}) = 0$ and $\psi (\frac{a}{2}) = 0$ impose
\begin{align*}
	\psi \left(-\frac{a}{2}\right) &= 0 = A\cos \frac{ka}{2} - B\sin \frac{ka}{2} \\
	\psi \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)  &= 0 = A\cos \frac{ka}{2} + B\sin \frac{ka}{2}
\end{align*}
so that $B = 0$ and
\begin{align*}
	0 &= 2A \cos \frac{ka}{2} \\
	\frac{(2n+1){\pi}}{2} &= \frac{ka}{2} \\
	k &= \frac{(2n+1){\pi}}{a}
\end{align*}

We already had a relation for $k$ defined, so substitute and solve for the
energies $E_n$.
\begin{align*}
	\frac{(2n+1)^2{\pi}^2}{a^2} &= \frac{2mE}{{\hbar}^2} \\
	E_n &= \frac{(2n+1)^2{\pi}^2{\hbar}^2}{2ma^2}
\end{align*}

Then considering $\psi (x,t)$, the complex exponential is periodic in time with
period
\begin{align*}
	T_n &= \frac{2{\pi}{\hbar}}{E}
\end{align*}
where $n = 0$ will be the case with the longest periodicity, so
\begin{align*}
	T &= \frac{2{\pi}{\hbar}\cdot 2ma^2}{{\pi}^2{\hbar}^2} \\
	{} &= \frac{4ma^2}{{\pi}{\hbar}}
\end{align*}

Therefore, the function is periodic in time with a periodicity
\begin{align}
	\boxed{
	T = \frac{4ma^2}{{\pi}{\hbar}}
	}
\end{align}

Consider a system of $N$ independent classical molecules, each at a fixed position, with magnetic moment $\mathbf{\mu}$ in an external magnetic field $B$. Determine the partition function, and hence find the free energy and the magnetization at temperature $T$, when the molecules can only be oriented parallel or antiparallel to the external magnetic field.

A photon collides with a stationary electron. If the photon scatters at an
angle $\theta $, show that the resulting wavelength ${\lambda}'$ is given in terms of the
original wavelength ${\lambda}$ by
\begin{align*}
	{\lambda}' &= {\lambda} + \frac{h}{mc} (1 - \cos \theta )
\end{align*}
where $m$ is the mass of the electron.

\subsubsection{Answer}
Start by considering conservation of momentum for the system. The initial values
are
\begin{align*}
	p_{\gamma x} &= \frac{h}{{\lambda}}		&		p'_{\gamma x} &= \frac{h}{{\lambda}'} \cos \theta  \\
	p_{\gamma y} &= 0					&		p'_{\gamma y} &= \frac{h}{{\lambda}'} \sin \theta  \\
	p_{ex} &= 0					&		p'_{ex} &= ? \\
	p_{ey} &= 0					&		p'_{ey} &= ?
\end{align*}
and considering each component in turn:
\begin{align*}
	\frac{h}{{\lambda}} + 0 &= \frac{h}{{\lambda}'}\cos \theta  + p'_{ex}
		& 0 &= \frac{h}{{\lambda}'}\sin \theta  + p'_{ey}
	\\
	p'_{ex} &= \frac{h}{{\lambda}} - \frac{h}{{\lambda}'}\cos \theta 
		& p'_{ey} &= -\frac{h}{{\lambda}'}\sin \theta 
\end{align*}
The total momentum of the electron is then
\begin{align}
	p^2_e &= \left( \frac{h}{{\lambda}} - \frac{h}{{\lambda}'}\cos \theta  \right)^2 +
		\left( -\frac{h}{{\lambda}'}\sin \theta  \right)^2
		\nonumber
	\\
	{} &= \frac{h^2}{{\lambda}^2} - \frac{2h^2}{{\lambda}{\lambda}'}\cos \theta  + \frac{h^2}{{\lambda}'^2}\cos ^2\theta  +
		\frac{h^2}{{\lambda}'^2}\sin ^2\theta 
		\nonumber
	\\
	p^2_e &= h^2 \left( \frac{1}{{\lambda}^2} + \frac{1}{{\lambda}'^2} \right) -
		\frac{2h^2}{{\lambda}{\lambda}'}\cos \theta 
\end{align}

Then consider energy conservation, with initial values
\begin{align*}
	E_\gamma  &= \frac{hc}{{\lambda}}			&		E'_\gamma  &= \frac{hc}{{\lambda}'} \\
	E_e &= mc^2					&		E'_e &= \frac{{p'_e}^2}{2m} + mc^2
\end{align*}
leading to the equation
\begin{align*}
	\frac{hc}{{\lambda}} + mc^2 &= \frac{hc}{{\lambda}'} + \frac{{p'_e}^2}{2m} + mc^2
	\\
	\frac{hc}{{\lambda}} &= \frac{hc}{{\lambda}'} + \frac{h^2}{2m} \left( \frac{1}{{\lambda}^2} +
		\frac{1}{{\lambda}'^2} \right) - \frac{2h^2}{2m{\lambda}{\lambda}'}\cos \theta 
	\\
	\frac{hc}{{\lambda}} - \frac{hc}{{\lambda}'} &= \frac{h^2}{2m} \left( \frac{1}{{\lambda}^2} +
		\frac{1}{{\lambda}'^2} \right) - \frac{2h^2}{2m{\lambda}{\lambda}'}\cos \theta 
	\\
	\frac{{\lambda}' - {\lambda}}{{\lambda}{\lambda}'} &= \frac{h}{2mc} \frac{{\lambda}'^2 + {\lambda}^2}{{\lambda}^2{{\lambda}'}^2} -
		\frac{h}{mc{\lambda}{\lambda}'}\cos \theta 
	\\
	{\lambda}' - {\lambda} &= \frac{h}{2mc} \left( \frac{({\lambda}' - {\lambda})^2 + 2{\lambda}{\lambda}'}{{\lambda}{\lambda}'} \right) -
		\frac{h}{mc}\cos \theta 
	\\
	{\lambda}' - {\lambda} &= \frac{h}{2mc} \left( \frac{({\lambda}' - {\lambda})^2}{{\lambda}{\lambda}'} + 2 \right) -
		\frac{h}{mc}\cos \theta 
	\\
	{\lambda}' - {\lambda} &= \frac{h}{2mc} \frac{({\lambda}' - {\lambda})^2}{{\lambda}{\lambda}'} + \frac{h}{mc}(1 - \cos \theta )
\end{align*}
The difference in the wavelengths is small, so
\begin{align*}
	\frac{({\lambda}' - {\lambda})^2}{{\lambda}{\lambda}'} &\approx 0
\end{align*}
leading to the final Compton scattering equation
\begin{align}
	\boxed{
	{\lambda}' = {\lambda} + \frac{h}{mc}(1 - \cos \theta )
	}
\end{align}

The composition of a glass block varies as a function of the distance $x$ from the top surface. Thus the index of refraction $n(x)$ increases as a function of $x$ according to the relationship $n(x) = 1.50 - (0.20) /(x +1)^2 $, where $x$ is expressed in centimeters. A beam of light strikes the surface with an angle of incidence $\theta_i$ , measured from the vertical, as shown in the figure opposite. What will be the direction of the beam deep inside the block?
