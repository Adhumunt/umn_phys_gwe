% From http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/49298/what-settings-for-xspaceskip-would-you-suggest-for-linux-libertine?rq=1
% Bringhurst suggests these values for body text: m/3 (even better if you can
% keep it at m/4) for interword space, m/2 for maximum space, and m/5 for
% minimum space. He also feels strongly against using the extra space after
% sentences, so assume \frenchspacing.

	% Then make the inclusion of hyperref and hypcap the last things done
	% before the end of the preamble.
	%
	% IMPORTANT NOTE!
	%   It took much debugging to figure out that biblatex makes use of the
	%   \AtEndPreamble command to finalize much of its setup, especially with
	%   respect to knowing if hyperref has been loaded or not. For this reason,
	%   loading hyperref with \AtEndPreamble as well *after* we've already
	%   loaded biblatex means the code below is executed after code that
	%   biblatex has loaded into the hook.
	%
	%   To guard against such mistakes (and assumptions that hyperref was
	%   loaded in the user-written preamble which will definitely occur
	%   before the hook), we can instead *prepend* our code to the hook that
	%   \AtEndPreamble normally appends to. We do this by patching a copy of
	%   the command to use \gpreto instead of \gappto.
	%
	\let\PreAtEndPreamble\AtEndPreamble%
	\patchcmd{\PreAtEndPreamble}{\gappto}{\gpreto}{}{%
		\PackageError{defaults}{%
			Prepending to the \verb|\AtEndPreamble| hook failed. Could not

		}{%
			Loading hyperref is a tricky business, and our attempt to have
			hyperref load at the correct time when also using biblatex failed.
			A guess would be that the format of the \verb|\AtEndPreamble|

			our purposes has failed.
