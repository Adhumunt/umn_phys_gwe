UMN Graduate Written Exam
=========================

## Purpose

This is a fork of JMERT's existing GWE solutions and is largely a continuation of that project. The purpose of this fork is to develop the omnibus as to help future students prepare for the GWEs.

## Updates

In this fork, you will find the following updates;
- Expanded solutions from 2010 - 2018.
- Expanded flashcards.
- Expanded index of problems.
- Expanded question bank from 2000 - 2018.
- Removal of deprecated fonts and Greco-Roman glyphs.
- Spelling and typo fixes.

## JMERT's README

Solutions to the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of
Minnesota's past Graduate Written Exams (GWE). The solutions can be built by
running `xelatex` on `solutions.tex`.

There is also an accompanying file, `flashcards.tex`, which provide a set of
quick references in physics in flashcard form. The document makes use of the
`flashcards` package and can be easily modified to make use of different types
of pre-cut papers; the default makes use of Avery 5371 perforated paper.

Notes on compiling the documents
--------------------------------
Because I mainly have taken care of these sets of solutions myself, there may
be some incompatibilities when transfered to other systems. In particular, I
make use of the XeLaTeX system rather than the typical pdfLaTeX system, so
there are additional font dependencies beyond what TeXLive typically provides.
A best effort has been made to make the solutions compilable (if not pretty)
when using pdfLaTeX instead of XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX, but no promises are made.
