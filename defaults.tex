% CONFIGURABLE OPTIONS
% ********************
%
% There are a few configurable options that if set before the file is loaded
% will override defaults set here. In order to override a feature, simply
% declare a macro with the desired value. For example, to define the default
% font color used throughout the document, one should provide a command such
% as
%     \newcommand{\deftextcolor}{0,0,0,0.5}
%
% TODO: Use pgfkeys as a way to get and set options instead? Maybe something
%       like
%           \def\optdefaults{%
%               textcolor      = {0,0,0,1},
%               stretchyparens = 0
%               ...
%            }
%            \input{defaults}
%
% The following options are current recognized and supported:
%
% COMMAND              DEFAULT VALUE        DESCRIPTION
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \deftextcolor        0,0,0,1              The default text color is any valid
%                                           CMYK color value supported by the
%                                           xcolor package. Currently, no
%                                           support is available for setting
%                                           the default in other color spaces.

% COMMANDS PROVIDED
% *****************
%
% This section documents some commands which may be necessary due to the
% modifications which are made by default, either overriding a previous change
% locally or restoring the LaTeX default functionality.
%
% COMMAND              DESCRIPTION
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \definetextcolor     Change the font color of the body text. Attempts are
%                      made to propagate the changes into all environments,
%                      but see the inline documentation for a list of the
%                      exceptions/caveats.
%
% \resetparents        By default, all parentheses in math mode made stretchy,
%                      but this may be undesirable in some context, so this
%                      command restores them to their default, inactive state.

%% Make some amsmath fixes
%
% As of 2012-12-23 (XeTeX version 3.1415926-2.4-0.9998, TeXLive 2012), XeTeX

% Because of this, the macro \binom which internally uses these these commands

% LuaTeX doesn't seem to suffer from this.

	% Taken from I.-M.:
	% “
	%   Many of these macro patches are gonna take work, since the color
	%   commands aren’t hooking well into the \rule family of commands. They’re
	%   pretty fragile to start, and occasionally \color commands “bleed” their
	%   color past their local contexts.
	%
	%   According to The LaTeX Companion, TeX’s \hrule command is actually used
	%   in the default LaTeX definition of \footnoterule instead of LaTeX’s
	%   \rule command in order to avoid strange effects of \rule, which
	%   actually starts a paragraph and related calculations. KOMA-Script
	%   modifies the footnote definition, but it still appears to be patchable.
	%
	%   If the below patch fails, the undefined macro \xpatchfailed will be
	%   “executed”, resulting in an undefined control sequence error, and will
	%   stop processing. A successful patch will be silent.
	%
	%   [TO-DO] Create a macro that writes a confirmation of the successful
	%           patch either to the terminal or a logfile during compilation.

%% Make all parentheses stretchy
%
% By default, all parentheses are just normal parentheses in math mode. This
% to me doesn't seem to make sense since I almost always want them to be
% stretchy.
%
% Adapted from http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/7359/how-to-make-a-real-backslash-escape-character/7372#7372
	% Start by defining a macro to quickly reset the default behavior if we
	% decide that a given environment shouldn't use the active definition. We
	% need the \edef so that the \the\mathcode is immediately expanded before
	% we change things.
	\edef\resetparens{%
			\mathcode`(=\the\mathcode`(
			\mathcode`)=\the\mathcode`)
		}
	% Now we actually do the magic like this:
	%   1) Start a local group so that we can temporarily define a lowercase
	%      tilde to be the left paranetheses and not affect anything later in
	%      the document.
	%      a) We use the tilde because it is already defined to be an active
	%         character. This saves a step since to define a character to
	%         execute a macro sequence, it first needs to be active. The
	%         \lowercase command does for us since the lowercase tilde (i.e.
	%         paren) is made to have the same category code as its uppercase
	%         counterpart.
	%   2) \lccode assigns the lowercase tilde to be the left paren
	%   3) Then use \lowercase to cause us to define the macro of active left
	%      paren (without explicitly changing category codes).
	%      a) The \endgroup ends the local group we just started, but not
	%         before lowercase has already learned how to convert the tilde
	%         This lets the next \edef to be at the current global scope,
	%         avoiding use of \global
	%   4) Then define the active left paren to be the sequence \left( so that
	%      we invoke the stretchy code
	%   5) Finally change the mathcode of the left paren to be active within
	%      math environments, meaning we don't have to worry about the
	%      character being active in normal text mode.
	\begingroup%
			\lccode`~=`(%
			\lowercase{\endgroup\edef~}{\left(}
		\mathcode`(="8000
	% Do it again for the right paren
	\begingroup%
			\lccode`~=`)%
			\lowercase{\endgroup\edef~}{\right)}
		\mathcode`)="8000
	% Finally, this change of math codes breaks some changes the amsmath
	% package makes to the definitions of \left( and \right), so we fix this
	% by patching the internal amsmath macro which breaks to be prepended with
	% the \resetparens command
