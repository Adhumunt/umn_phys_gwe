\begin{enumerate}
	\item Beginning with the Lorentz transformations show that when an object is moving with velocity $v_2$ in a reference frame that is moving with velocity $v_1$ with respect to an observer, the velocity $v$ of the object as seen by the observer is:
	\begin{equation}
		v = \frac{v_1+v_2}{1+v_1v_2/c^2}
	\end{equation}
	\item A spaceship is initially at rest with respect to frame $S$. At a given instant, it starts to accelerate with a constant acceleration, $a$, in the instantaneous rest frame of the spaceship. What is the relative speed of the spaceship in frame $S$ when the spaceshipâ€™s clock reads time $t$? (c) The command center, which is stationary in frame $S$, communicates with the spaceship by using a laser with a wavelength of $\lambda_s$. What would be the wavelength of the laser beam observed on board the spaceship at time t?

Consider a free Fermi gas of $N$ electrons in two dimensions confined to a square of area $A$. (a) Find the Fermi energy $(\epsilon_F)$ in terms of $N$ and $A$. (b) Derive the formula for the density of states and show that it is independent of energy. (c) Use this to find the chemical potential $\mu$ as a function of $N$ and the temperature. (d) What is the behavior of the system at low temperature?
\subsubsection{(Partial) Answer}
To find the Fermi energy, we only need to solve the Schroedinger equation for an infinite potential well in two dimensions. The energy levels for this system are well known;
\begin{equation}
	E_{n_1n_2} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\qty[\frac{n_x^2}{\ell_x^2} + \frac{n_y^2}{\ell_y^2}] = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}k^2
\end{equation}
where $k^2$ is the magnitude of the wave vector in $2$D. In order to obtain the Fermi energy, first split the $2$D surface into squares of width $L$. Then center a circle on the corner of a square. Since electrons are fermions, they will fill up one a quadrant of the circle in $k$ space whose radius $k_F$ is determined by the fact that each pair of electrons requires an area $A\sim L^2$. Let $N_q= qN$ denote the number of free electrons, then the Fermi relation says (area of the circle contained in the square) = (number of electrons per unit lattice area)
\begin{align}
	\frac{1}{4}\qty(\pi k_F^2) = \frac{N_e}{2}\qty(\frac{\pi^2}{A}) \implies \boxed{k_F^2 = \frac{2\pi}{A}N_e = 2\pi n_e.}
\end{align}
Solving for the energy leads us to $\epsilon_F = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}k_F^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}2\pi n_e.$
