You are asked to design a yo-yo that accelerates, as it drops, with a value tenth that of the acceleration due to gravity $g$. Yo-yo's are formed by two disks of radius $R$ and connected by a spindle, of a smaller radius $r$, around which a string is wound (the string goes down vertically from your hand to the spindle). The spindle and the string have negligible mass, and the combined mass of the two disks is m. What should be the ratio $R/r$ needed to achieve this acceleration as the yo-yo drops from a stationary hand holding onto the yo-yo string?

Let us consider two identical linear harmonic oscillators 1 and 2 separated by $R$. Each oscillator bears charges $\pm e$ with separation $x_1$ and $x_2$, as shown in Fig. The particles oscillate along the $x$ axis. Let $p_1$ and $p_2$ denote the momenta. The force constant is $C$. All particles have mass $m$. Then the Hamiltonian of the non-interacting system is
\begin{equation*}
	H_0 = \frac{1}{2m}p_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}Cx_1^2+ \frac{1}{2m}p_2^2+ \frac{1}{2}Cx_2^2
\end{equation*}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Write down the Coulomb interaction energy $(H_1)$ between all the charged particles. Then take the approximation, $\abs{x_{1,2}}\ll R$ and obtain the leading term.
	\item By applying the normal mode transformation to the total Hamiltonian $(H_0+H_1)$,show the characteristic frequencies of these coupled oscillators are 
	\begin{equation*}
		\omega = \qty[\qty(C\pm \frac{2e^2}{R^3})/m]^{1/2}

Consider a system of $N$ non-interacting particles each with a spin $S = 1$ and fixed position in an external magnetic field $H$. The particles have magnetic moment $\mu_B$. If no magnetic field is present all spin projections $S_z$ of a single particle are degenerate with an energy $E = 0$.

a) Plot the energy for all spin projections as a function of $H$.

b) Calculate the partition function of a single spin and then of the system as a function of the temperature and magnetic field $H$.

c) Calculate the average energy $\expval{E}$ of the system and find its form for $T \to 0$.
