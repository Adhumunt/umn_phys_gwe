A zipper has $N$ links; each link has a closed state with zero energy and an
open state with energy $ε$. We require, however, that the zipper can only
unzip from the left end, and that the link number $s$ can only open if all
links to the left (i.e.\ $1, 2, \ldots s-1$) are already open.
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item
        Find an explicit expression for the partition function by doing the
        appropriate summation.
    \item
        In the limit $ε≫k_B T$ find the average number of open links. This
        model is a very simplified model of the unwinding of two-stranded
        DNA molecules.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Answer}

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item
        Create the partion function by induction; start by assuming there is
        only a single link. Then the partition function is a simple two-state
        system:
        \begin{align*}
            Z₁ &= e^0 + e^{-ε/k_BT} = 1 + e^{-ε/k_BT}
        \end{align*}
        Adding a second link,
        \begin{align*}
            Z₂ &= \underbrace{e^{0+0}}_{\text{both closed}} +
                \underbrace{e^{(-ε+0)/k_BT}}_{\text{1 open, 1 closed}} +
                \underbrace{e^{(-ε-ε)/k_BT}}_{\text{both open}}
            \\
            {} &= 1 + e^{-ε/k_BT} + e^{-2ε/k_BT}
        \end{align*}
        Following, for three links:
        \begin{align*}
            Z₃ &= \underbrace{e^{0+0+0}}_{\text{all closed}} +
                \underbrace{e^{(-ε+0+0)/k_BT}}_{\text{1 open, 2 closed}} +
                \underbrace{e^{(-ε-ε+0)/k_BT}}_{\text{2 open, 1 closed}} +
                \underbrace{e^{(-ε-ε-ε)/k_BT}}_{\text{all open}}
            \\
            {} &= 1 + e^{-ε/k_BT} + e^{-2ε/k_BT} + e^{-3ε/k_BT}
        \end{align*}
        By induction, we see that the maximum coefficient in the series of
        exponential factors is just the number of links, so by induction we
        conclude that
        \begin{align*}
            Z &= \sum_{s=0}^{N} e^{-sε/k_BT}
        \end{align*}
        Applying the results of a finite geometric series, the closed-form
        solution for the partition function of the links is
        \begin{align}
            \boxed{
            Z = \frac{1 - e^{-(N+1)ε/k_BT}}{1 - e^{-ε/k_BT}}
            }
        \end{align}
    \item
        To get the average number of open links, we use the standard
        procedure for finding expectation values.
        \begin{align*}
            \expect{s} &= \frac{1}{Z} \sum_{s=0}^N s e^{-sε/k_BT}
        \end{align*}
        By making use of differentiation under the summation trick, we can
        find the closed-form solution:
        \begin{align*}
            \expect{s} &= \frac{1}{Z} \sum_{s=0}^N
                \frac{d}{d(\frac{ε}{k_BT})} \Big[ -e^{-sε/k_BT} \Big] \\
            {} &= -\frac{1}{Z} \frac{∂}{∂(\frac{ε}{k_BT})}
                \sum_{s=0}^N e^{-sε/k_BT} \\
        \intertext{
        Noting that the summation is the same as above,
        }
            \expect{s} &= -\frac{1}{Z} \frac{∂Z}{∂(\frac{ε}{k_BT})}
        \end{align*}
        First considering just the derivative part:
        \begin{align*}
            \frac{∂Z}{∂(\frac{ε}{k_BT})} &=
                \frac{(N+1)e^{-(N+1)ε/k_BT}}{1 - e^{-ε/k_BT}} -
                \frac{1 - e^{-(N+1)ε/k_BT}}{(1 - e^{-ε/k_BT})²} e^{-ε/k_BT}
        \intertext{
        which when combined with the factor $-1/Z$ simplifies to
        }
            -\frac{1}{Z} \frac{∂Z}{∂(\frac{ε}{k_BT})} &=
                -(N+1)\frac{e^{-(N+1)ε/k_BT}}{1 - e^{-(N+1)ε/k_BT}} +
                \frac{e^{-ε/k_BT}}{1 - e^{-ε/k_BT}}
            \\
            -\frac{1}{Z} \frac{∂Z}{∂(\frac{ε}{k_BT})} &=
                \frac{1}{e^{ε/k_BT} - 1} - \frac{N+1}{e^{(N+1)ε/k_BT} - 1}
        \end{align*}
        Therefore the analytic solution is
        \begin{align}
            \boxed{
            \expect{s} = \frac{1}{e^{ε/k_BT}-1} - \frac{N+1}{e^{(N+1)ε/k_BT}-1}
            }
        \end{align}
        In the limit that $ε≫k_BT$, though, the exponentials in the denominator
        are very large in comparison to 1, so we ignore the unity factors
        and make the approximation that
        \begin{align*}
            \expect{s} &= e^{-ε/k_BT} - (N+1)e^{-(N+1)ε/k_BT}
        \intertext{
        Collecting like terms,
        }
            {} &= \left[1 - (N+1)e^{-Nε/k_BT} \right] e^{-ε/k_BT}
        \intertext{
            The second term in the brackets approximate zero, so
        }
            {} &= e^{-ε/k_BT}
        \end{align*}
        Therefore in the low temperature limit where the thermal energy is
        much less than the energy of the open state,
        \begin{align}
            \boxed{
            \expect{s} = e^{-ε/k_BT}
            }
        \end{align}
\end{enumerate}
