A particle of mass $m$ is constrained to move without friction on a circular
wire of radius $R$ rotating with constant angular frequency $ω$ about a
vertical diameter. Gravity can not be neglected.

        Find the equilibrium position(s) of the particle and determine
        whether this position is stable.
    \item
        Calculate the frequency of small oscillations about any stable points.

\subsubsection{Answer}

To start constructing the Lagrangian and equations of motion, we first specify
the kinetic and potential energies. For the kinetic energy, there is an energy
associated with the rotation about the axis and one along the bead. These
combined to give
\begin{align*}
    T &= \frac 12 m (Rω\sin θ)² + \frac 12 m (R\dot θ)² \\
    {} &= \frac 12 m R² ω² \sin² θ + \frac 12 m R² {\dot θ}²
\end{align*}
The potential energy is all gravitational, so
\begin{align*}
    V &= -mgR\cos θ
\end{align*}
where the zero point was taken to be at the center of the hoop to avoid adding
extra constant terms to the Lagrangian. Combining the two, we get
\begin{align}
    \boxed{
    \mathcal L = \frac 12 mR²ω²\sin² θ + \frac 12 mR²{\dot θ}² + mgR\cos θ
    }
\end{align}
Taking the appropriate derivatives in $θ$, the equation of motion is
\begin{align}
    \boxed{
    \ddot θ = ω² \sin θ \cos θ - \frac{g}{R}\sin θ
    }
\end{align}

In order to determine any possible stable points, we note that a stable point
is a place where the angle does not change in time. Since this also equates to
$\ddot θ = 0$, we set the equation above equal to zero and solve for the angles
which satisfy this condition. They end up being the trivial $θ = \{0, π\}$
where the sine function is zero as well as
\begin{align*}
    \cos θ₀ &= \frac{g}{Rω²}
\end{align*}
The three stable points are then
\begin{align}
    \boxed{ θ₀ = \left\{ 0, \arccos(\frac{g}{Rω²}), π \right\} }
\end{align}

To determine the stability of each, we must determine whether we get
oscillatory or exponential solutions to the differential equation of motion.
To do this, we suppose the angle $θ$ is composed of the equilibrium angle
$θ₀$ and a small perturbation $δ$. Expanding the equation in terms of this,
\begin{align*}
    \ddot δ = ω²\sin(θ₀+δ)\cos(θ₀+δ) - \frac{g}{R}\sin(θ₀+δ)
\end{align*}
Using several trigonometric expansions, the equation can be expanded into the
form
\begin{align*}
    \ddot δ = ω²\left[ \cos θ₀\sin θ₀ (\cos²δ - \sin²δ) + \cos δ\sin δ
        (\cos²θ₀ - \sin²θ₀) \right] - \frac{g}{R}\left[ \sin θ₀\cos δ +
        \cos θ₀\sin δ \right]   
\end{align*}

For the case where $θ₀ = 0$,
\begin{align*}
    \ddot δ &= ω² \cos δ \sin δ - \frac{g}{R} \sin δ
\intertext{Expanding to first order in $δ ≈ 0$,}
    \ddot δ &= -(\frac{g}{R} - ω²)δ
\end{align*}
Therefore, the equilibrium point $θ₀ = 0$ is only stable if $ω <
\sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}$.

Likewise for for $θ₀ = π$,
\begin{align*}
    \ddot δ &= (\frac{g}{R} + ω²) δ
\end{align*}
The coefficient on $δ$ will never be negative, so the angle $θ₀ = π$ will
be unstable under all conditions.

For the final angle where $θ₀ = \arccos(\frac{g}{Rω²})$, we must do several
substitutions and expansions. $\cos θ₀$ is trivial. $\sin θ₀$ ends up being
$\sqrt{Rω² - g²}/(Rω²)$ by triangle relations. If we substitute these in plus
do an expansion to first order for small $δ$, we get the equation
\begin{align*}
    \ddot δ &= ω² \left[ \frac{g\sqrt{Rω²-g²}}{R²ω²} + δ \frac{2g²-Rω²}{R²ω²}
        \right] - \frac{g}{R} \left[\frac{\sqrt{Rω²-g²}}{R²ω²} + δ
        \frac{g}{Rω²} \right]
\end{align*}
If we consider only the homogeneous terms dependent on $δ$,
\begin{align*}
    \ddot δ &= \frac{g² - Rω²}{R²ω²} δ
\end{align*}
This equation is stable if and only if the coefficient on $δ$ is negative, so
it must be that $ω > \frac{g}{\sqrt{R}}$.

In summary, the equilibrium points have the following conditions:
\begin{align}
    \boxed{ θ₀ = 0 \quad\quad \text{Stable iff } ω < \sqrt{\frac gR} }
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    \boxed{ θ₀ = \arccos(\frac{g}{Rω²}) \quad\quad \text{Stable iff }
        ω > \frac{g}{\sqrt{R}} }
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    \boxed{ θ₀ = π  \quad\quad \text{Never stable} }
\end{align}


About the two stable points, we simply use the coefficient that has already
been isolated to determine the frequency of the oscillations about that point.
\begin{align}
    \boxed{ ω₁ = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R} - ω²} \quad\quad\text{for $θ₀ = 0$} }
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    \boxed{ ω₂ = \sqrt{\frac{Rω² - g²}{R²ω²}}\quad\quad\text{for $θ₀ =
        \arccos(\frac{g}{Rω²})$} }
\end{align}
